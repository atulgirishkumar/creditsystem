While everything could be implemented with just a few classes, let’s develop Graviton as a fully-fledged enterprise application.

We’ll structure the code using a Controller, Service, and DAO layer framework. For testing, we can utilize JUnit 5 and Mockito.

**Data Handling**

We can store all data in a single file called the in-memory database.
This can be structured to be like an index of a database.

**Requirements**
- Create pricing information.
- Buying and using credits.
- Transactions must be recorded to generate history.
- For now, we’ll ignore non-functional requirements and concentrate solely on functional ones.
  - Aim to write clean and elegant code.
  - loggin will just use System out

**API Design.** 

Let’s outline the necessary APIs:
1. Create Services
2. Create Credit Packages
3. Buy Credits
4. Use Credits
5. Get Transaction History (this will be accessed directly via the DAO)

**Implementation Plan**

First, we’ll implement the core business logic in the Service layer. 
Next, we’ll develop the DAO layer, followed by the Controllers. 
Making some trade-offs with object instantiation for testing purposes, can revert after adding Dependency Injection.
For multitenancy support, later we can add account id to the schemas. 

**I/O Handling**.

Here are a few points to consider:
- Need to create a generic reader and writer.
- Implement data validations
- Decide between the Template and Strategy patterns (going with Template as more suitable to the strucutre)

**Code Review/Refactoring**

- Review and refactor possible optimizations.

**Code Packaging**

- Jar
- Docker image
